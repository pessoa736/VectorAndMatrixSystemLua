      Vector and Matrix System (Lua) â€” a simple library to create and manipulate
      mathematical vectors and matrices in N dimensions. Focused on practical use
      (games/simulations). Interfaces are still evolving; there is no stable API yet.
      API type: Lua modules accessed via `require`. Work in progress.
